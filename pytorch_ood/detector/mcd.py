    From the paper *Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning*.
    Forward-propagates the input through the model several times with activated dropout and averages the results.

    The outlier score is calculated as

    where :math:`\\sigma` is the softmax function.

        This could also affect other modules and is currently a workaround.
